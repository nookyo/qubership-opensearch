# Qubership OpenSearch 1

Qubership OpenSearch is a comprehensive solution for deploying OpenSearch in Kubernetes with High Availability (HA), Disaster Recovery (DR), and Multi-AZ setups.
Includes tools for backup management, monitoring, database as a service API and integration testing to ensure reliable operation and security.
Designed for creating resilient and secure OpenSearch clusters in a cloud-native environment.

## How to start

### Deploy to k8s

#### Pure helm

1. Build operator and integration tests, if you need non-main versions.
2. Prepare kubeconfig on you host machine to work with target cluster.
3. Prepare `sample.yaml` file with deployment parameters, which should contains custom docker images if it is needed.
4. Store `sample.yaml` file in `/charts/helm/opensearch-service` directory.
5. Go to `/charts/helm/opensearch-service` directory.
6. Run the following command:

  ```sh
  helm install opensearch-service ./ -f sample.yaml -n <TARGET_NAMESPACE>
  ```

### Smoke tests

There is no smoke tests.

### How to debug

#### VSCode

To debug Operator in VSCode you can use `Launch operator` configuration which is already defined in 
`.vscode/launch.json` file.

The developer should configure environment variables: 

* `KUBECONFIG` - developer should **need to define** `KUBECONFIG` environment variable
  which should contains path to the kube-config file. It can be defined on configuration level
  or on the level of user's environment variables.
* `OPENSEARCH_USERNAME` - username for REST API access.
* `OPENSEARCH_PASSWORD` - password for REST API access.
* `OPENSEARCH_HOST` - OpenSearch's Ingress.
* `OPENSEARCH_NAME`, `WATCH_NAMESPACE`.

### How to troubleshoot

There are no well-defined rules for troubleshooting, as each task is unique, but there are some tips that can do:

* Deploy parameters.
* Application manifest.
* Logs from all OpenSearch service pods: operator, OpenSearch, monitoring and others.

Also, developer can take a look on [Troubleshooting guide](/docs/public/troubleshooting.md).

## Evergreen strategy

To keep the component up to date, the following activities should be performed regularly:

* Vulnerabilities fixing.
* OpenSearch upgrade.
* Bug-fixing, improvement and feature implementation for operator and other related supplementary services.
